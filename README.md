  2. **Welcome onboarding screen**
  3. **Instructions onboarding screen**
  4. **Shoe Listing screen**
  5. **Shoe Detail screen**: For adding a new shoe
  
While the login and onboarding pages will not do anything, the user will need to save the login state so that the login and onboarding pages do not show again on navigating back.The shoe listing page will show the list of shoes and show a button for adding a new shoe, while the detail page will be for adding a shoe entry. All entries will be saved only as long as the app is running and the data entered is not persistent.
